## Usage

You need to set the following headers to authenticate succesfully in every API

'headers' => [

    'Accept' => 'application/json',

    'Authorization' => 'Bearer '.$accessToken,
    
]

Where $accessToken is the token generated by the /api/token route. In this example you don't have to give login parameters, just request the token.
